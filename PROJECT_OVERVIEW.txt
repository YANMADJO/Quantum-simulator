Quantum Simulator Web Application

Overview

This is a Flask-based web application designed to simulate quantum circuits using Qiskit,
visualize results, and provide educational resources on quantum computing. Users can run quantum simulations
locally or on IBM Quantum hardware, explore quantum gates and algorithms,
and access quantum computing news and scientific papers via NewsAPI and arxiv.

In order to have full access to the website features:
1- Python Environment: use Python 3.10+ with dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

2- Login: Users must register and log in to access simulation tools,
 learning resources, news, and papers.
 The registration form requires a username, email, and password.

3- NewsAPI Key (Optional): To fetch news (/news), users need a NewsAPI key
from newsapi.org. Set it in .env as NEWSAPI_KEY. If not provided, news features are disabled.

4-IBM Quantum Account: To use hardware simulation (/hardware_simulation),
users need an IBM Quantum account and API token from quantum-computing.ibm.com.
Set the token in .env as IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN.
